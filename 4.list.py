'''Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python. A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects. Lists are mutable.

List in Python are ordered and have a definite count. The elements in a list are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index. Each element in the list has its definite place in the list, which allows duplicating of elements in the list, with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.
Note- Lists are a useful tool for preserving a sequence of data and further iterating over it.'''



'''IMPORTANT - Difference between Methods and Functions is that Methods are bound to an object whereas Functions are not bound to an object.Functions operate on the data you pass to them as arguments. Methods are dependent on the class they belong to. They operate on the object that you pass to them.'''

# Tuples


# A tuple is an immutable 
# (canâ€™t change or modified) data type in Python.

a = ()              #It is an example of empty tuple
a = (1,)            #Tuple with only one element needs a comma
a = (1, 7, 2)       #Tuple with more than one element

# Creating a Tuple
# with the use of built-in function
